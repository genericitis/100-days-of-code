# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 7, 2021

For the 100 days of code challenge I began this github account (done on the 5th Nov,21) as well as signing in to www.freecodecamp.org to begin going through the curriculum. 

Until I've started on some projects it'll be progress tweets here. I'm keeping a thread on twitter for each days progress. Will put the first post of the threads below for each day.

I had begun also working through Jason Cannon's book on Python Programming and doing some exercises for it. It's not part of the 100daysofcode challenge but can only do me good. This'll be my progress log for it all.

Day 1 was summarized thusly; 

"CSS (and HTML/HTML5) section complete. That's two hours on Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode."
"Lrning css color codes while color blind. IS THIS THING ON?" (red/green colour defect vision is what I'm told i'm dealing with)

### Day 2: November 8, 2021

Finished out the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design Certification today. More colour work. I found an internal voice screaming DON'TCAREDON'TCAREDON'TCARE when reading of the 'importance' of color. I've been working in networking the last 18 years so web design, while will be good to know, isn't necessarily my end goal, design isn't a passion for me so much. Not saying no to anything though.

This afternoon went through the intro to github to get a better understanding of how not to break things here, and thus here is this log.md update. This'll be handy going forward as my notepage.

I reference work interruptions, which flies in the face of the 100days rule of not doing the challenge while at work, but I have little choice and it's not work as such as i'm not an employee where I am.

Dinner then getting stuck into the next section on Applied Acessibility (a title done on the fcc [until further notice if i use FCC I mean freecodecamp.org] website in such a way that couldn't be copied easily for copy/paste.)

### Day 3: November 9, 2021

First update, get the dates right for today and the last two days (was a day early, nothing to do with the US going through daylight savings, promise.

Today is onto the Applied Accesibility section. Didn't go any further last night. 

From the FCC site; "Note: Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of colorblindness." makes me wonder if it's possible to do a visual simulation of how colours appear for non-colourblind people for colourblind people. (I'm red/green colour defect).

Ok, that's the Applied Accessibility section complete. I'm finding myself just running through this stuff and making sure i can complete the exercises. This doesn't feel like a lot I need (or more want) to remember, at least to know to be able to understand when looked up.

Next is the Responsive Web Design Principles. Only four sections/exercises to it before the CSS Flexbox section with 17 parts. I'll do the RWDP then bed time.

That's done. Bed time. Night :)

Here's todays twitter thread; https://twitter.com/connectcoding/status/1458006815015194636?s=20

2m later update (from the tweet thread); I should have the Responsive Web Design learnings complete by tomorrow, just saw after the CSS Flexbox is  CSS Grid (22 sections) then it's onto some Responsive Web Design Projects. That's building five separate pages. Then that's the first FCC cert done. Not going to say I'll have that last section in a day, will wait till I see what's involved before I go making predictions.


### Day 4: November 10, 2021

Now to knock over the CSS flex and grid sections before bed. Won't be much commenting, just bashing this out before sleep and a million and one other things I have to get done.

Ok. That's done. Night. Soundtrack -  Underworld - The Biggest Weekend Belfast 26.05.2018 Full Show HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPzqHToMf7U
